# Introduction
The *Student Activity Centre* (SAC) is a student-led space in the Fabrication Lab block. It is a space for student clubs and research groups to conduct their activities and more.



This is a living document, and policy suggestions are welcome: Just make sure you raise an issue!

## Core Philosophy

The SAC is a place that is there to **support student activities and provide them an enclosed space to work**. It is primarily _not_ a storage space (excepting the rooms, which are used by student clubs).

## General Housekeeping:

### Cleanliness

The SAC furniture is to be kept *clean and tidy*. Don't be that person who slobbers all over tables and ruins it for everyone.

At the same time, make sure that the floor is clear of detritus and the like before you leave! Nobody likes working on dirty floors.

### Garbage:

If the bin in the SAC is already full, *please clear it before you go*. Nobody likes to have a workspace filled with pests.

### Food and Drinks:

Food and Drinks are okay to have (for now) in the SAC; just *make sure you clean up after yourself* if you spill anything. Once again, **nobody** likes a space filled with pests.

## SAC Spaces and Storage:

***Please note: The SAC open areas are NOT FOR STORAGE!***

Any items stored there not following the policies below will be ***reported and then promptly disposed of.***

### Open Areas:

The open access areas accessible by the use of the SUTD student card is meant for activities only, and are open to all students.

As a general rule of thumb, **nothing** is to be stored in the open access area. Storage in any location that *does not come with a lock* (that is, the lockers and other storage devices) needs to be requested through the following process:

1. Write an Email to ROOT's Student Initiatives email (si@studentgov.sutd.edu.sg) detailing the following:
   - What kinds of items you are intending to store;
   - Rough size of item you are storing
   - The dates you need to store things for (**NO PERPETUITY.**)
   - Who is in charge, and how they are to be contacted
2. Receive approval in writing from ROOT SI.
3. Move your items in on your indicated date, and place them down *neatly.*
4. Remove your items once your event is done, and dispose of it appropriately.

### Rooms & Room Policy

The rooms are currently meant for official school clubs to store items that they commonly use, or long-term holdings that are expensive and valuable.

That means that only Offical School Clubs (having an official email) may apply for space within the rooms.

Currently, the process for applying for room-based space involves the following:

1. Make it known to your Cluster Rep that you have some expensive/bulky item that your club wishes to store.
2. These items have to be inventoried properly within a spreadsheet that you should also send in to your Cluster Rep when you apply.
3. Your Cluster Rep will help you to arrange for a space to store items in one of the rooms within the SAC, ***if and only if space is available.***

Spaces like these are subject to re-allocation every half-year or so, unless you can continue to prove that you have both the need, and the will to upkeep all the items and the space you place them in.

### Other Storage Spaces

As of the time of writing, an alternate set of spaces are available for application: a set of lockers, which are key-based, and are approximately the size of a cutting mat (and about 25cm deep).

Once again, any Official School Club may apply for this space through their Cluster Rep, who will let them know what spaces are available.
